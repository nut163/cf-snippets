The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML): All the files are written in CFML, which is the scripting language used in ColdFusion. 

2. Snippet Structure: Each file follows a similar structure, which includes a brief description of the snippet, the code itself, and an explanation of how it works.

3. README.MD: This file serves as a guide to navigate through the snippets. It contains links to all the other files in the repository.

4. CFML Functions: Many of the files contain CFML functions, which are reusable pieces of code designed to perform a specific task.

5. Error Handling: Several files include error handling techniques, which are used to manage and respond to errors that occur during the execution of the CFML code.

6. Database Operations: Some files contain code for performing operations on a database, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

7. Form Handling: Some files include code for handling HTML forms, which allow users to enter data that is sent to a server for processing.

8. Date and Time Functions: Some files contain functions for manipulating dates and times.

9. String, Array, and Struct Functions: These files contain functions for manipulating strings, arrays, and structs, which are data structures used in CFML.

10. Query, XML, and JSON Functions: These files contain functions for working with queries, XML, and JSON, which are used to store and transport data.

11. RESTful Services: Some files include code for creating and consuming RESTful services, which are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the internet.

12. AJAX Integration: Some files contain code for integrating AJAX, which is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.

13. Caching Techniques: Some files include techniques for caching, which is a way of storing copies of files or data in a cache to reduce server load.

14. Security Best Practices: Some files contain best practices for securing CFML applications.

15. Performance Tuning: Some files include techniques for improving the performance of CFML applications.
